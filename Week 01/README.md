## ðŸ“š Week 1 - Arrays, Strings & Hashing

Welcome to Week 1 of my **#50DaysDSAChallenge**!  
This week focuses on mastering fundamentals in **Arrays, Strings, and Hashing**, covering frequently asked interview questions and custom practice problems.



### âœ… Topics Covered

- Arrays (traversals, patterns, frequency)
- Strings (manipulation, comparison, compression)
- Hashing (frequency map, anagram check)

| 6  | Pairs with Given Sum             | Find pairs whose sum equals a target             | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum = 6         | [1,5], [2,4]      |
| 7  | Anagram Checker                  | Check if two strings are anagrams                | "listen", "silent"              | true              |
